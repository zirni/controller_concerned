Organize your controller and place each action/functionality in a separate file.
Especially if your controller actions are too big you can use concerned_controller.
I know, the better way is to refactor your controller code to avoid masses of lines,
but if you haven't enough time for refactoring, try this.

  class UsersController < ApplicationController
    include ControllerConcerned
    concerned_controller
  end
  
For UsersController concerned_controller will include all *.rb files
found in controller/users_concerns
